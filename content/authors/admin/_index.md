Hello there, I am Raphaël Urfin, a PhD student at École Normale Supérieure – PSL, working at the intersection of **statistical physics** and **machine learning** under the supervision of **Giulio Biroli** (ENS–PSL) and **Marc Mézard** (Bocconi University).  
His research focuses on the theoretical understanding of learning processes in high-dimensional systems, inspired by methods from disordered systems and statistical mechanics.  
I hold master from the **ICFP program** in the Theoretical Physics track at ENS–PSL.
